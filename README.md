# Gauss-Jordan-Matrices
This program allows the user to perform operations to solve a system using Gauss-Jordan Elimination. The program allows minimum of two equations
and a maximum of four equations. The variables for a two equation system is x and y and for three/four equations is x, y and z variables. 

The number of columns will always be four.

The equations are read from a .txt file 

Example:

3.5x+2.95y+.3z=-2

1z+5y-3x=10


Fractions are not allowed for equations or row operations.


All variables will be to the left of the equal sign

The variables can be in any order

After each row operation, the modified matrix will be displayed.

If the matrix is in reduced echelon form, the variables and
their known values as illustrated by the matrix will be displayed and the program will terminate.

If a row has already been solved, row operations won't be allowed.

The menu option for the porgram is followed:

1 – Switch two rows


  Prompt the user for the number of the rows to switch
  
2 – Multiply row by non-zero number


  Prompt for row and number to multiply
  
3 – Add scalar multiple of one row to another row


  Prompt for the following in order


4 - Quit Program
